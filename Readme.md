# Oolite assets
This repository contains source files for various images and sounds in Oolite, and design sketches. The ships and textures are probably all obsolete. This stuff is mostly of archaeological significance.

## File types
* .graffle: [OmniGraffle document](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/). This is a proprietary graphing tool, in this case used as a vector graphics editor.
* .svgz: [Scalable Vector Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), an interchange format.
* .mesh: [Meshwork document](http://www.codenautics.com/meshwork/). This is an obsolete PowerMac-specific triangle mesh editor. The file format is trivial.
* .wings: [Wings 3D document](http://www.wings3d.com). This is a cross-platform mesh editor.
* .sndbldr3: Sound Builder 3. This is an obsolete PowerMac-specific audio synthesizer. The data probably can't be recovered without finding a copy of the application.
