The texture files for all models used in Oolite are located in the Resources/Textures folders. 
This folder contains textures for models that were created with the aim of being included in core
Oolite v1.80 and later, but did not make it in for various reasons.

At the time of writing this text, the following textures for alternative models are included:
- Icosahedron Station alternative station design (oolite_ico_diffuse.alt.png and
  oolite_ico_hull_diffuse.alt.png), corresponding to models oolite_ico.alt.obj and
  oolite_ico_hull.obj in the ModelsPost-1.80-obj folder.
